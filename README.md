# TempoScript

## Overview

TempoScript is a minimalist web application designed to transform your Markdown presentation scripts into guided, timed performances. It's ideal for situations where you need a cue-based presentation system but lack access to traditional presentation tools.  Think of it as a teleprompter for your Markdown notes, with built-in time management.

This project is **98% AI-generated**.  It's an experiment to explore the capabilities of AI in software development, leveraging various AI tools throughout the entire process.

## Features

*   **Markdown Editing & Preview:** Write and edit your presentation script in Markdown. See a live preview of your rendered Markdown.
*   **Time Markers:** Control the pacing of your presentation with a simple, intuitive time marker system.
*   **Presentation Mode:** A distraction-free presentation view that highlights the current section and tracks your time.
*   **Time Tracking:**  Visual timers for total elapsed time, current block time, and parent block time (if applicable).
*   **Error Handling:** Real-time validation of time markers to ensure consistency and prevent errors.
*   **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Local Storage:** Your work is automatically saved in your browser's local storage.

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/mhruiz/TempoScript.git
    cd TempoScript
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies (with --force):**
    ```bash
    npm install --force
    ```
    **Important:**  Due to some dependency conflicts, you *must* use the `--force` flag during installation.  This is a known issue and a consequence of the experimental, AI-generated nature of this project.

3.  **Run the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4.  **Open in your Browser:**
    Open `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.

## How to Use

### View/Edit Mode

*   **Write/Paste Markdown:** Enter your presentation script in the Markdown editor on the left.
*   **Preview:** See a live preview of your rendered Markdown on the right.
*   **Time Markers:** Use the following syntax to add time markers:
    *   `?mm:ss`  -  Main block (e.g., `?10:00` for 10 minutes).
    *   `??mm:ss` -  First-level sub-block.
    *   `???mm:ss` - Second-level sub-block, and so on.
    *   `?!!` - Section with no time control (timers still display, but no progress animation).
    *   `??!!` - Nested section with no time control (use the appropriate number of `?` for the nesting level).
    *    Seconds must be multiples of 5.
*   **Error Handling:**  The application will highlight errors in your time markers (e.g., invalid format, time inconsistencies).  You must correct these errors before starting the presentation.
* **Expand the Editor**: Double click on it

### Presentation Mode

*   **Start Presentation:** Click the "Start Presentation" button.
*   **Timers:**
    *   **Total Elapsed Time:**  Shows the total time since the presentation started.
    *   **Block Time:**  Shows the time allocated to the current block.
    *   **Block Elapsed Time:** Shows the time spent in the current block.
    *   **Parent Time (if applicable):**  Shows the time allocated to the parent block.
    *   **Parent Elapsed Time (if applicable):** Shows the time spent within the current parent block.
*   **Progress Indicator:** A visual bar that fills as the block time elapses.  It will change color and blink when the allocated time is exceeded.
*   **Navigation:**
    *   **Play/Pause:** Start and pause the timers (and auto-advancement).
    *   **Next:**  Advance to the next block (resets block timer).
    *   **Previous:** Go back to the previous block (resets block timer).
    *   **End:** Exit presentation mode.
*   **Auto-Advance:** A switch enables automatic advancement to the next slide when the block timer runs out.
* **Keyboard shortcuts**:
   * Space or P: Play/Pause
   * -> or N: Next slide
   * <- or B: Previous slide
   * Esc: Exit presentation
   * H: Toggle help

## Time Marker Rules

*   Seconds must be multiples of 5 (00, 05, 10, 15, ..., 55).
*   Nested markers must have one more `?` than their parent.
*   The time of a child block cannot exceed the time of its parent block.
*   `?!!` blocks disable the progress animation but still track elapsed time within their parent.
*   All time markers *must* be on their own line.

## Development Notes

This project uses:

*   **Next.js:**  React framework for building the application.
*   **Tailwind CSS:**  Styling.
*   **Shadcn/ui:**  UI components.
*   **CodeMirror:**  Markdown editor with syntax highlighting.
*   **React Markdown:**  Markdown rendering.
